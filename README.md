#Course Outline:
The course is intended as a first graduate course in the design and analysis of algorithms. The focus is on developing an understanding of the major algorithm design techniques. Algorithmic techniques covered include divide and conquer, greedy, and dynamic programming. Other topics include network flow, NP-completeness, approximation algorithms, and linear programming. At times, the practical side of algorithm design and implementation is also explored with examples of their usage in solving industry problems.

#Course Outcome:
A good understanding of major algorithm design and analysis techniques
Ability to design, analyze complexity of, and prove correctness of moderately difficult problems
A good understanding of the NP, NP-complete, and NP-hard classifications and ability to demonstrate hardness of NP-complete problems
Ability to solve problems through reduction such as reduction to network flow problems (max flow, min cut, feasible circulation) or linear programming
An understanding of different methods to solving problems approximately
Overall better problem-solving skills
