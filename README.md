# CSCI - 570 -- Analysis of Algorithms

## Course Outline:
The course is intended as a first graduate course in the design and analysis of algorithms. The focus is on developing an understanding of the major algorithm design techniques. 

## Algorithmic techniques covered include:
- Divide and Conquer
- Greedy
- Dynamic Programming.
## Other topics include: 
 - Network flow
 - NP-completeness
 - Approximation algorithms
 - Linear Programming.


At times, the practical side of algorithm design and implementation is also explored with examples of their usage in solving industry problems.

## Course Outcome:
- Understand major algorithm design and analysis techniques  
- Design, analyze complexity of, and prove correctness of problems  
- Understand NP, NP-complete, and NP-hard classifications  
- Demonstrate hardness of NP-complete problems  
- Solve problems using reductions (network flow, linear programming, etc.)  
- Apply approximation methods  
- Improve overall problem-solving skills
